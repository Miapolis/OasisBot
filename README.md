## Contribution Rules
>- Don't contribute code if you don't know what you are doing (duh)
>- Write decent code (I am not that incredible myself so the bar is not that high)
>- All **new** features need to be approved by Joey and not me, so refrain from adding new things without permission 
>- With content and dialogue for the bot, **please make sure that proper grammar, punctuation, etc. is used**
>- Use the **issues** tab instead of directly fixing something to report issues and bugs
>- Comments are amazing! Use them!
>- If you're questioning doing something, don't do it
>- Have fun? 

## How it Works
>- This bot is made using a custom made command handler, so all commands are in the 'commands' folder
>- 'bot.js' is the equivalent of 'index.js' in some applications and essentially is the starting point of the application
>- All database schemas are inside the 'schemas' folder
>- Everything else I believe is pretty self-explanatory
