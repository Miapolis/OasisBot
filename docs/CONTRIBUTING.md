## General Guidelines 
>- Don't do anything if you don't know what you're doing
>- Write *decent* code - I am not that incredible myself but here are some examples of what that would look like:
>>1) Keep it simple stupid. Simpler is always better. Reduce complexity as much as possible.
>>2) Use searchable, descriptive, and unambiguous names
>>3) Clarify yourself as much as possible in comments 
>>4) I should be able to understand it
>- A lot of these were based off of [these guidelines](https://gist.github.com/wojteklu/73c6914cc446146b8b533c0988cf8d29). Make sure to read them!

## Consistency 
>- Of course, **always** follow standard conventions
>- If you do something a certain way, do all similar things in the same way. 
>- Keep what you write consistent with existing code (for example, there are no semicolons for line endings here) 
>- **Please ensure** that all content and dialogue that comes out of the bot **follows all proper grammar rules** 

## Other Rules
>- Avoid adding completely new things, as they most likely have to be approved by Joey 
>- If there is a need to update database schemas, core systems, etc. create an issue and explain why your contribution would require that
>- Make sure to check out the issue templates provided when creating issues
>- Have fun? 

## How to Contribute
>1) Essentially, you need to fork the repository, create your own branch, and then create a pull request 
>2) Follow tutorials like [this one](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github)
>3) If you're not much for the command line, I recommend the [GitHub Desktop Client](https://desktop.github.com/)
